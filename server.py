(aka: making up facts!)  In this blog post, I will show you how to let your visitors search your website and get ChatGPT-style responses from your content — without making up facts .  In short : Search Your Website With ChatGPT .    So without further ado, let’s get started.  Why Use ChatGPT Indexed On Your Website Content?  There are many reasons to use ChatGPT with your Website content, the biggest being: Better customer engagement.  Nobody wants customers and visitors to be frustrated with “No results found” or aimlessly browsing the site to find what they are looking for.\n* title: How To Build A Custom ChatGPT Chatbot From Google Results - CustomGPT ” to limit results to a specific website, or even “filetype:pdf” to search for specific file types. This allows you to tailor the information your CustomGPT chatbot ingests, enhancing its relevance and usefulness to your specific needs.  Q7: Can I build a chatbot with all the pages in Google for my website?  A7: Yes, absolutely. You can use the “site:yourdomain.com” search operator to generate a list of all the pages on your website that are indexed by Google. This list can then be used to build a sitemap and subsequently, a CustomGPT chatbot. This will allow the chatbot to have a deep understanding of your site’s content and be able to answer specific questions related to it.  Q8: I am working on a research project. Can a CustomGPT chatbot help me?  A8: Absolutely.\n* title: How To Build A ChatGPT Chatbot For Site Search - CustomGPT or you can use this helpful sitemap finder .  Step 2 : Build your CustomGPT Bot  The next step is to have CustomGPT suck in all your content and index it (using OpenAI’s language models). This might take a few minutes, depending on how much content you have.   Test Your Bot In The CustomGPT Dashboard Once your bot is built, you can test it in the dashboard with some queries and see if the results are good for your website visitors.   CustomGPT Embed Widget If you are satisfied with the responses, grab the “Embed” code from the “Project Settings”.  Step 3 : Embed the Widget Into Your Website  At this stage, you have a functioning chatbot working with your content + ChatGPT and are ready to copy-paste the code into your website.

So we’d be looking at either the top plan or a custom plan. I have a few questions about building the sitemap:  1. Should we include public URLs that may have already been scanned/ingested by ChatGPT? 2. By specifying our desired URLs does that give the data on those pages more “weight” than other pages scanned by ChatGPT?\n* title: How To Build Your Own Personal ChatBOT On Any Topic - CustomGPT One of the simplest methods is to use Google to search for relevant websites and then use ahrefs to export the list.  To build my Tom Brady list, I simply searched Google for a bunch of Tom Brady related keywords and then used ahrefs to download the list .   Step 3: Create the Sitemap  Once you’ve cleaned your URLs, it’s time to create your sitemap. You can use this free online tool to create your sitemap. Use the Copy option to copy the link to the sitemap.  Build Your CustomGPT Chatbot  And now, the final step: To build your personal custom ChatGPT-style chatbot based on the webpages you collected, do these simple steps:  Step 1: Setup Project in CustomGPT  Once you sign up for CustomGPT , select “Create Project” and enter your validated sitemap URL into your Project.  Step 2 : Enjoy!\n* title: How To Build A ChatGPT Chatbot For Site Search - CustomGPT © Copyright 2023        Facebook-f       Twitter       Linkedin       Youtube        Company   About Us   Blog   Security & Trust   Testimonials   Contact Us   Affiliate Program   Pricing     Tools   Live Demo   Upload PDF   Free Tools   Documentation   API   ChatGPT Plugin Builder   Make My Custom Instructions     Most Popular        Advancements and Innovations in ChatGPT-Driven Research    How To White-Label A Custom ChatGPT Chatbot For Your Clients    How To Stop ChatGPT From Making Things Up – The Hallucinations Problem    Exciting News: Upload Your Documents To Your ChatGPT-Powered Chatbot       Privacy Policy      Cookie Policy      Terms and Conditions\n* title: How To Build A ChatGPT Chatbot For Site Search - CustomGPT In this example, it’s expected that the website is an expert in Indoor plants and so the responses are conversational responses based on the content of that website.  Consider this response to a search query – the response was conversational and based on the expertise of that particular website – not a generic answer from Google or ChatGPT.   ChatGPT Expert Response Based on WordPress Content How Does It Work?  To index your website content and then send it to ChatGPT, we use two systems:   CustomGPT : This system indexes your website content using the OpenAI large language models.  ChatGPT API : This API along with the relevant data from your content responds to the user’s query.   CustomGPT  To be able to do this, CustomGPT first crawls, parses and indexes all your content in its databases and gets it ready to be searched using OpenAI language models.\n--END OF CONTEXT--	To index all your website's content for building a ChatGPT chatbot, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Generate a List of Your Website Pages:**\n   - Use the "site:yourdomain.com" search operator in Google to find all the pages on your website that are indexed by Google.\n   - Alternatively, you can use a sitemap finder tool to help you gather all your URLs.\n\n2. **Build Your CustomGPT Bot:**\n   - Sign up for CustomGPT and create a new project.\n   - Input your validated sitemap URL into your project settings.\n   - Allow CustomGPT to index your content using OpenAI’s language models. This process may take a few minutes, depending on the volume of content.\n\n3. **Test Your Bot:**\n   - Once your bot is built, test it in the CustomGPT dashboard.\n   - Enter some queries to see if the bot's responses are accurate and satisfactory for your website visitors.\n\n4. **Embed the Chatbot Widget on Your Website:**\n   - If you're happy with the bot's performance, obtain the "Embed" code from the "Project Settings".\n   - Embed the code into your website, or if you're not familiar with this process, ask your web developer for assistance.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a chatbot that can search your website and provide ChatGPT-style responses based on your content.

# Role: You are a SQL developer creating queries for Amazon Athena.

# Task: Generate SQL queries to return data based on the provided schema and user request. Also, returns SQL query created.

1. Query Decomposition and Understanding:
   - Analyze the user’s request to understand the main objective.
   - Break down reqeusts into sub-queries that can each address a part of the user's request, using the schema provided.

2. SQL Query Creation:
   - For each sub-query, use the relevant tables and fields from the provided schema.
   - Construct SQL queries that are precise and tailored to retrieve the exact data required by the user’s request.
3. It is important that the SQL query complies with Athena syntax. During join if column name are same please use alias ex llm.customer_id in select statement. It is also important to respect the type of columns: if a column is string, the value should be enclosed in quotes. If you are writing CTEs then include all the required columns. While concatenating a non string column, make sure cast the column to string. Make sure use database name correctly provided in database info. For date columns comparing to string , please cast the string input.
